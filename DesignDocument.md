## Overall Idea
- 2D Game (isometric or hexagonic)
- Pixelart
- Round based
- Make your civilization thrive

## Gameplay
- Round starts with choosing one of three tiles
- During the round the player must collect and distribute resources to the tiles
- Round ends with clicking 'Finish Round' --> collections and distributions get executed
- Needs of the population (e.g. food and warmth) needs to be fulfilled
- Two type of tiles: terrain and building tiles

## User Interface
- Label: food supply
- Label: wood supply
- Label: round count
- Button: "Finish Round"

## Tiles
- Water tile (terrain) --> not placable
- Grass tile (terrain)
- Forest tile (terrain)
- Farmer tile (building --> on top of grass tile)
- Wood cutter tile (building --> on top of forest tile)

## World
- One starter tile (grass), the rest are all water tiles
- Terrain tiles expand the land mass
- Building tiles needs to be placed on top of terrain tiles

## Further Ideas
- Spreaded out islands in the distance with one time resources
- Tech tree for receiving new tiles types
- More needs afte certain amount of rounds
